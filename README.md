# Backend Project Showcase

## Overview

This repository demonstrates my expertise in building robust and scalable backend applications using .NET Core and Entity Framework. The project showcases a comprehensive backend solution with advanced features and best practices.

## Key Features

* **Persistence Layer**: Implemented using Repository Pattern and Entity Framework Core for efficient data access and management
* **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure authentication using HTTP Basic Authentication and authorization using claims-based authentication and policies
* **User Management**: User registration, login, and management with password hashing and verification
* **API Endpoints**: Protected endpoints for user management, robot commands, and maps using authorization attributes
* **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling and testability using dependency injection
* **Reverse Engineering**: Database schema and models recreated through reverse engineering of existing database

## Technology Stack

* **.NET Core**: Built using .NET Core for high-performance and cross-platform compatibility
* **Entity Framework Core**: Utilized Entity Framework Core for efficient data access and management
* **Handlebars or T4**: Advanced templating using Handlebars or T4 libraries
* **Postman**: API testing using Postman

## Project Structure

* **Controllers**: API controllers for user management, robot commands, and maps
* **Models**: Entity models for users, robot commands, and maps
* **Persistence**: Persistence layer implementation using Repository Pattern and Entity Framework Core
* **Templates**: Advanced templating using Handlebars or T4 libraries
